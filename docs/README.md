## How to Use This Documentation

Each document follows a consistent structure:
1. **Overview** - What the component does and why it exists
2. **File Structure** - Location and organization of files
3. **Key Features** - Important functionality and capabilities
4. **Integration Points** - How it connects to other parts of the system
5. **Configuration** - Setup and customization options
6. **Development Workflow** - How to work with the component
7. **Architecture Decisions** - Why specific choices were made

## Reading Order for New Developers

1. Start with **01-project-foundation.md** to understand the overall structure
2. Follow the numbered sequence to learn about each component
3. Refer back to earlier documents when working on integration features

## Maintenance

- Each new feature or component should have corresponding documentation
- Update documentation when making architectural changes
- Keep code examples in sync with actual implementation
